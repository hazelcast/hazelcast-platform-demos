#
# Random Forest prediction mechanism.
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Input:
#  CSV data with a control command.
#  If CSV begins "model," the next field the model name, then a Base64 encoded model
# to upload.
#  If CSV begins "data," the next fields are the clickstream key, two timestamps, 
# then 23 true/false values (0==false, 1==true) for clickstream actions.
#  Eg. "data,neil,123,456,1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1"
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Output:
#  CSV data with a control command
#  For input command "model," output is the model name from the input
#  For input command "data," output is "data," + clickstream key and timestamps,
# the model version, and finally buy or not-buy prediction (0==not-buy, 1==buy). 
# So for above input the output "neil,123,456,somethig,1" for a buy prediction
# ------------s----------------------------------------------------------
# Note:
#  Until a model is input, prediction guesses, "random.randint(0,1)"
