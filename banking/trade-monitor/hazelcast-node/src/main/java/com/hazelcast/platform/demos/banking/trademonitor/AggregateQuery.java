/**
 * <p>Creates a pipeline job to "<i>query</i>" Kafka trades.

 * <p>Really what this does is a <b><i>continuous</i></b> aggregation.
 * </p>
 * <p>All trades are read from Kafka. We treat the Kafka stream as
 * continuous. Although the stock market has opening and closing hours,
 * other markets such as crypto-currencies are 24 hours a day.
 * </p>
 * <p>With a continuous input, we produce a <i>rolling aggregate</i>,
 * the running total since the start. We could if we had wanted do
 * a "<i>last 5 minutes</i>" approach, lots of ways exist.
 * </p>
 * <p>So the essence here is to read from Kafka, just like
 * {@link IngestTrades} and to write the answer into an
 * {@link com.hazelcast.map.IMap} just like {@link IngestTrades}.
 * What is different is that in-between we summarise by 3 factors,
 * the simple count, the volume ({@code price * quantity)}, and
 * the latest price.
