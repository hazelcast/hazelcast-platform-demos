# Simplist assessment of whether current trading in a stock is due to
# institutional investor making few large transactions or multiple individual
# investors making small transactions with a similar cumulative effect.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Input:
# A series of transactions in JSON format:
# {"id": "c6dcc88c-5f1c-4c0d-ae7f-6518e5bb187a","timestamp": 1617797114225,"symbol": "GEVO","price": 2499,"quantity": 5913}
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Output:
# Assessments of stock trading, in CSV format:
# GEVO,WHALE
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Note:
# (1) The same stock may feature more than once in the input item list,
# but this isn't considered. Each item is assessed in isolation,
# missing the chance for added value.
# (2) The code has a "sleep()" to simulate complex processing that
# takes a while to run.
